# Client

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Every file is linted strictly with ESLint using the AirBnB config.

## Structure

App.jsx is the main component that handles the state of the application. It uses components from the [/components](/client/src/components/) directory (Dropdown, Chart, Top5...).

data.js is used to handle requests between the server and the client.
